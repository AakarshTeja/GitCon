## GitCon
- GitCon is nothing but Git Conferences. The main idea is to have close interaction within the team about Codes since everyone are doing WFH(WorkFromHome). 
- This feature of having a video Conferences within GitHub can make the developers have a good understanding of whats goind in their codebase and know about the progress community or company.

## Q&A
- Why only *GitCon* Why not using external video calling ??
- A) Since the main focus is discussing about CodeBase and if we integrate with GitHub it can make the Project have more focus on project and code through the discussions within the team. Our GitCon helps them to solve this problem of having less interaction within team to collaborate with eachother.
